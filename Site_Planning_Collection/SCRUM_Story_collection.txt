#CURRENT SCRUM-BAG: Allen
#Week 2,3,10: Allen
#Week 4,5,11: Matt
#Week 6,7: Daryl
#Week 8,9: Hunter

#IF YOU GUYS WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING HERE, EMAIL CURRENT SCRUM-BAG. DON'T WORRY, HE'S A NICE GUY.

# Due to the dumb way I implemented this, I'm going to clarify what this stuff means.
# 
# âœ” = completed (copy and paste this symbol)
# pts = how many points Allen and Matt guestimated each part is worth
# (P 1-3) = top priority to low priority
# (P 4) = Not a priority, but a nice quality of life addition AKA: I'm bored and want to try something
# (P ?) = Does this need to be done, even?
# TTL = total points for a "mini project" NOTE: TTL doesn't include (P 4)

#TODO FOR SCRUM MASTER: Get time amounts of how long it ACTUALLY TOOK for completed stuff
# 						then calculate points vs. actual time = hours per points.
#						Then make a nice looking graph to display how many points
#						are left vs. how long it actually takes.
#
#						Also move this from a text file to something nicer with a table and a graph chart.
#						(maybe ms access for the table, whats good for a graph? Paste them into a word/pdf document?
#						It's looking real cheap right now.
