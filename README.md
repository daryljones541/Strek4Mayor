# Strek4Mayor
Capstone Project

THINGS TO DO BEFORE FIRST RELEASE:

HIGH PRIO:
•Get donate button working ◦No fancy stuff like database collecting info, just the button

•Remove most bootstrap stuff
•Add banner to project ◦shared layout view

•About Stefan page. ◦separate from the issues home page like we planned ◾(Stefans self description is too long to contain in a single page)



LOWER PRIO: (BUT STILL NICE TO GET DONE)
•Make images for Issues(Can Matt do this too?) ◦Simple icons would work for this. ex(http://i.imgur.com/CEfO2Yg.png) ◾No MS paint drawing, but that kind of color scheme is what we should go for (probably)


•Get nav bar working ◦Have american flag in background of buttons
◦Do css magic and fade out the under construction pages ◾Also make then not clickable


•Issues page ◦static for now. needs images to accompany each issue

•General CSS niceties. ◦This may have to be held off untill we have a good plan on what it should all look like instead of each person doing a little bit with their own ideas on how it should look
