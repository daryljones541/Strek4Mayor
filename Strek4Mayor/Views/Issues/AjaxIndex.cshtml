            <h2>Housing Assistance</h2>

            <p>

                We have a vision that is based on a functional working model.
                Our plan is to emulate the program operating out of Austin, TX known as "Front Steps".
                Their program provides, housing, medical assistance, therapy services, social networking and a variety of functions.
                Flexibility of funding sources through grants, local donations, and other sources allows for this community resource to be one of the most successful models in the country.
                The Strek Campaign believes we can develop a similar, improved program here in Eugene, Oregon.

            <h2>Animal Assistance</h2>

            <p>
                We speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.Many homeless or low-income residents of our communities have animal companions
                who don't get regular veterinary check-ups,
                this can lead to detrimental health situations for the animal companions of our city.
                Our plan is to use city resources to establish a facility that networks with local veterinary students,
                these students would receive vital training in their chosen profession through both customer relations and
                practicing routine veterinary care. The Strek Campaign believes this is a cost-effective way to provide a much needed
                community service.By helping animals, we can help the people who depend on those animals for emotional support.

            <h2>Community Development</h2>

            <p>

                We believe in open spaces. Areas like Saturday Market, Kesey Square and our public parks need to be safe, clean, and preserved as they are for future generations.
                Eugene's availability of park space overshadows it's lack of public gathering space, we believe successful communities want public social areas and aim to bring a healthier,
                more open environment across Eugene.
